# microbit-image_send
Two separate programs - one to send images, one to receive.

This demonstrates one-way communication.
The sender broadcasts image strings over the bluetooth radio.
The receiver listens for strings and displays them as images.
The sender code contains a function to convert the stock (built-in) images to image strings for broadcast.
